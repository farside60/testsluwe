# Blackjack

**Luring in might still be a bit wonky, luring out should work fine**

**This plugin currently has client freezing/crashing issues.
I've tried several things to get rid of them but nothing seems to work. Not entirely sure what the cause is,
but it happens on NPC interactions and my guess is it has something to do with the fact that the targets get
knocked down. If anyone knows of a fix, let me know.**

It is able to blackjack, drink jugs of wine and buy new ones from the bar. Supports all 3 target
types and 2 rooms; the northern one with the ladder and the single south-western one. You can let the plugin
try and lure a target in, but it's best to just set it up yourself. Lure your target in a room with just you and
the target. When the plugin goes to buy wines it will automatically hop back to your original world meaning it
should be fine as long as you don't get crashed. I advise you to keep an eye on this because of frequent
freezes/crashes and potentially being unable to set up a target again when things go awry.

Exchanging notes or other food is not supported.
