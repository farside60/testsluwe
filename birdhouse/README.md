# Bird house

This plugin does bird house runs for you, optionally including a seaweed run.
You can either start the run by clicking the start button, pressing the configurable hotkey, or
gathering all the materials yourself and teleporting to the house on the hill using the digsite pendant.

* Configurable logs
* Optional seaweed run, make sure you have spores in the bank and the tool leprechaun has compost and a seed dibber
* Optional TP to several useful locations after finishing the run
