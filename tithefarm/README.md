# Tithe Farm

Plays the Tithe Farm minigame for you. It does 25 plants in a single run which means you need either 10
watering cans or the Gricoller's can. You can start the plugin either inside or just outside the farm. It will
automatically take the highest possible seeds. If you don't have a seed dibber or a spade, it will take one
from the leprechaun. If you don't have one there you'll need to go get them yourself from the bank. If it feels
like the plugin is stuck after a run, it's probably just waiting for run energy. The character should have 50 run
energy before starting a new run.

It will deposit fruit at the configured amount or when you're out of seeds.

It will leave the farm if you're out of seeds or are at 900 points.

Can automatically buy rewards when over 900 points. (untested)
