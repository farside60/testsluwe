# Tithe Farm

Plays the Tithe Farm minigame for you. It does 25 plants in a single run which means you need either 10
watering cans or the Gricoller's can. You can start the plugin either inside or just outside the farm. It will
automatically take the highest possible seeds. If you don't have a seed dibber, a spade or watering cans, it will take
them from the leprechaun. If you don't have one there you'll need to go get them yourself from the bank. If it feels
like the plugin is stuck after a run, it's probably just waiting for run energy. The character should have 50 run
energy before starting a new run.

It will deposit fruit at the configured amount or when you're out of seeds.

It will leave the farm if you're out of seeds, are at 900 points, when you can buy a reward, or when you level
and can you use higher level seeds.

Can automatically buy rewards when over 900 points. The order of buying is the same as the configuration order.

**Note:** Farmer's outfit can be bought multiple times. The plugin will only buy every piece once as long as it's in
the inventory. If you bank them you should disable the buying option for each piece or the plugin will buy it again.
You should also disable the seed box and herb sack if you already have it, but it's not in your inventory. Even though
you can't buy it again, the plugin will leave the farm if it has enough points to buy one of these and it doesn't have
it in the inventory already.
